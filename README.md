# AddOutlookScheduletoObsidianDailyNote
 This Power Automate flow queries Outlook 365 to retrieve your list of meetings and adds them to your Daily Note in Obsidian.

 To install, go to https://make.powerautomate.com, select **My Flows** in the left navigation. Then select **Import** in the top nav, and select **Import Package**. Upload the latest released ZIP file and follow the prompts. You will have to edit the flow in the Power Automate editor to establish connections to your Microsoft 365 account.
 
 This version also uses OneDrive for Business to retrieve the rest of the Daily Note template file that comes after the schedule - I do it this way so I can easily change the template in Obsidian. Feel free to modify as required by your use case.
